How to Download Files

To automate or interact with window based application, we need 3rd party applications. The most popular tools are 
1. AutoIT
2. Sikuli  
(——AutoIT support for windows only——)

For AutoIT we have both advantage and disadvantage
Configuration is complex ( we need to install and setup)

For Sikuli we just need to add the dependency only and its very easy and simple to use when compared to AutoIT.
