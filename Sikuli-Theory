How to Download Files

To automate or interact with window based application, we need 3rd party applications. The most popular tools are 
1. AutoIT
2. Sikuli  
(——AutoIT support for windows only——)

For AutoIT we have both advantage and disadvantage
Configuration is complex ( we need to install and setup)

For Sikuli we just need to add the dependency only and its very easy and simple to use when compared to AutoIT.

How to Upload Files using WebDriver

Notes : 
Screen is a base class provided by Sikuli. It allows us to access all the methods provided by Sikuli.

A pattern is used, to associate an image file with additional attributes used in find operations and when acting on a match object.

Sikuli Methods:
Here to showcase some examples, I am going to use the same object of Screen class which I have taken in the above scripts.

1. Click on an element: screen.click(“path of your image”);
2. Double click on an element: screen.doubleClick(“path of your image”);
3. Right click on an element: screen.rightClick(“path of your image”);
4. Type on a text box: screen.type(“path of your image”, “Your text message”);
5. To find an element: screen.find(“path of your image”);
6. Element identification whether it exists or not: screen.exists(“path of your image”);
7. Drag and drop: screen.dragDrop(“path of your Source image”,”path of your Target image”);
To learn more on Sikuli, please refer this offical documentation.  I am concluding here on “Sikuli Tutorial for begineers”
